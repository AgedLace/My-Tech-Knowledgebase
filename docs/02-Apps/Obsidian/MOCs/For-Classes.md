### Four Step Process

- Create a Course MOC Note
    - serves as a 'homebase' for the course
    - itemize lecture topics, separated by units
    - Assignments and Syllabus
    
- Take Conceptual Lecture Notes (CLNs) During Class
    - take notes as you like
    - tag these with "#toProcess"
- Process Conceptual Lecture Notes After Class
    - find notes tagged with "#to Process"
    - process
        - review note
        - tidy it up
        - summarize main takeaway at the top
        - create concept notes
            - one idea forms the note's emphasis
            - other ideas are background contextual or supporting evidence
            - "There are no rigid disciplines in the universe, only concepts."
- Flesh Out Course MOC Note
    - WHY 
        - to develop comprehensive connected understanding of the lecture and class content
      - WHEN
          - before tests
          - end of semester
      - tag the CLNs with the course's class
